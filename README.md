# DA-21-DailyChallenge-Excel
I have established a repository for the submission of the  21 challenge Excel sheet, provided by the mentor
I have selected the employee ddetails Excel sheet for data exploration.
In the first step,I analyse the data column  and row-wise.
Allign the header from left to right using HOME tab .then, select the "Text Allignment" and choose the "Align Text left" option.
Next, I applied the filter option using the Home tab .then, select "Sort & Filter" and chose the filter option.
Next, in the Home tab ,i chose conditional Formatting and highlighted the blank cells using the "Highlight cells Rules" option.then selected a color and clicked "Done".This helps in easily identifying and verifying the blank spaces in the Excel sheet. 
In the Home tab , i changed the data format.i selected "General" dropdown and then chose the "short date"option.
